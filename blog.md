# ESCAPE 3340

ESCAPE 3340 was a one-day, holiday-themed, student-designed escape room for the Yale community. Participants had to solve electronic puzzles to escape, including an RFID "present matching" puzzle, a digital "power generator" puzzle, a Hall Effect-sensing wooden sleigh, and an interactive "naughty/nice map." Escape Room Designers watched from the control room, and were able to send commands to help/hinder escape room participants through a fully-networked interface.

At the end of the escape room, the _social deduction_ element was revealed to participants. The day before, one participant from each group was notified that they are "The Grinch," and were instructed to sabotage their group's progress. At the end of the escape room, participants were to vote out who they thought was The Grinch.

original plan: stranger things lights but didn't come in on time
put that aside, focused on the puzzle design/hardware
wanted to incorporate some type of conditional wheel (potentiometer)
a lot of escape rooms give hints but not in order so based on that, originally had maze idea but felt too simple
spent a lot of time designing the layered image, then divided full sketch into layers, vectorized then printed
kerf bend box to look nicer
potentiometer and number displayer (led) on same esp, only needs to be local but cindy and eric connected it to wifi and added the function of the spinning led when code is correct
magnet circle added to top so easier to hold (also on potentiometer led esp
